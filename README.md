 # 👋 Hi, I'm Md. Khalid Hasan

 **GIS Analyst | Remote Sensing & Spatial Data Specialist**  
  Dhaka, Bangladesh

I am a GIS and Remote Sensing graduate with hands-on experience in GIS digitization, land use mapping, spatial analysis, and development-oriented GIS projects. I have worked with satellite and drone imagery to support environmental planning, urban analysis, and data-driven decision-making. My academic background in Geography and Environment, combined with formal research training, allows me to contribute effectively to structured and impact-focused projects.
